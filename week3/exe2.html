    <h2>If you set your goals ridiculously high and it's a failure, you will fail above everyone else's success. -James
        Cameron</h2>
    <p>Hi there! Iâ€™m Ong Zhi Han, a 19 year old INFJ digital media designer from Penang, Malaysia. I proudly hold a
        Diploma of Digital Media from Dasein Academy of Art.

        I specialized at creating posters, social media postings, and websites.

        I like to break the rules when they were profound in my mind, so my key styles would be bold, modern, and
        experimental. While I love minimalist and brutalist designs, I always add a little spice to make my works stand
        out.</p>
