                <p class="text textjustify">"I Had Some Help" by Post Malone featuring Morgan Wallen delves into the
                    theme of toxic relationships, portraying how blame can be shared. The song emphasizes that both
                    parties contribute to the breakdown, not just one.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The lyrics reflect on mutual faults, resonating with listeners who have experienced complicated
                    romantic dynamics. Its country-infused sound features heartfelt, confessional lyrics balanced with a
                    light, buddy-drinking anthem vibe, making it relatable yet catchy.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The song was teased by Wallen in late 2023 and was highlighted by performances such as their
                    collaboration at Stagecoach 2024, which enhanced its popularity.

                You got a lotta nerve, don't you, baby?
                <br />I only hit the curb 'cause you made me
                <br />You're tellin' all your friends that I'm crazy
                <br />Like I'm the only one
                <br /><br />
                Why'd you throw them stones, if you
                <br />Had a wild hair of your own or two?
                <br />Livin' in your big glass house with a view
                <br />I thought you knew
                <br /><br />
                I had some help
                <br />It ain't like I can make this kinda mess all by myself
                <br />Don't act like you ain't help me pull that bottle off the shelf
                <br />Been deep in every weekend if you couldn't tell
                <br />They say teamwork makes the dream work
                <br />Hell, I had some help (help)
                <br /><br />
                You thought I'd take the blame for us a-crumblin'
                <br />Go 'round like you ain't guilty of somethin'
                <br />Already lost the game that you been runnin'
                <br />Guess it's catchin' up to you, huh
                <br /><br />
                You think that you're so innocent
                <br />After all the shit you did
                <br />I ain't an angel, you ain't heaven-sent
                <br />Can't wash our hands of this
                <br /><br />
                I had some help
                <br />It ain't like I can make this kinda mess all by myself
                <br />Don't act like you ain't help me pull that bottle off the shelf
                <br />Been deep in every weekend if you couldn't tell
                <br />They say, "Teamwork makes the dream work"
                <br />Hell, I had some help (help)
                <br /><br />
                It takes two to break a heart in two, ooh
                <br />Baby, you blame me and, baby, I blame you
                <br />Aw, if that ain't truth (oh)
                <br /><br />
                I had some help
