                <p class="text textjustify">"Pour Me A Drink" is a collaboration between Post Malone and Blake Shelton,
                    featured on Post Maloneâ€™s sixth studio album F-1 Trillion, which marks his debut in the country
                    genre.

                    <br />
                    The song is a lively anthem about unwinding after a tough week, showcasing a mix of themes from both
                    artists: Post Malone's frustration with daily grind and Shelton's portrayal of romantic regret.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The music video enhances this mood with scenes of a spirited lakeside party that turns out to be
                    part of Post Malone's dream sequence. Their chemistry and playful vibe are captured through
                    lighthearted scenes, reflecting the song's feel-good nature.

                Forty hours got me goin' out my mind
                <br />Dallas dropped another game in overtime
                <br />Caught a ticket speeding down the 65
                <br />Don't know where I'm goin'
                <br /><br />
                Guess I really went and messed it up again
                <br />Now, my baby's goner than the Tulsa wind
                <br />Judgin' by the stone-sober state I'm in
                <br />Need to crack one wide open
                <br /><br />
                Somebody pour me a drink, somebody bum me a smoke
                <br />I'm 'bout to get on a buzz, I'm 'bout to get on a roll
                <br />Yeah, I been breakin' my back just keepin' up with the Joneses
                <br />Y'all know what I mean, and y'all know how it goes
                <br />When it's up on a Friday and I'm paid, slide one over my way
                <br />I can't even think when I can hear one callin' my name (hey)
                <br />Somebody pour me a drink
                <br />Pour me a drink
                <br /><br />
                Bourbon-brown eyes tryna get me drunk
                <br />Ain't stoppin' 'til the bottle and the job is done
                <br />Hey, I think I might've found my future love
                <br />(Buddy, you should probably buy her one)
                <br /><br />
                Somebody pour me a drink, somebody bum me a smoke

                Somebody pour me a drink
                <br />Somebody pour me a drink
                <br /><br />
                Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
