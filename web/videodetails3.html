                <p class="text textjustify">"Chemical" by Post Malone, released as the lead single from his fifth studio
                    album in April 2023, delves into the emotional turmoil of navigating a toxic, on-and-off
                    relationship.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The song reflects themes of dependency and the cyclical nature of such love, symbolized by the term
                    "chemical" to highlight the uncontrollable, addictive nature of the bond.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Despite the longing for change, Post Malone acknowledges the pull of this connection as unavoidable,
                    emphasizing his struggle to move on and his acceptance of these emotions.

                Oxytocin makin' it all okay
                <br />When I come back down, it doesn't feel the same
                <br />Now I'm sittin' 'round, waitin' for the world to end all day
                <br />'Cause I couldn't leave you if I tried
                <br /><br />
                You break me, then I break my rules
                <br />Last time was the last time too
                <br />It's fucked up, I know, but I'm still
                <br /><br />
                Outside of the party, smokin' in the car with you
                <br />Seven Nation Army, fightin' at the bar with you
                <br />Tell you that I'm sorry, tell me what I gotta do
                <br />'Cause I can't let go, it's chemical
                <br />No, I can't let go, it's chemical
                <br /><br />
                Every time I'm ready to make a change
                <br />You turn around and fuck out all my brains (woo)
                <br />I ain't tryna fight fate, it's too late to save face
                <br />I can't get away, maybe there's no mistakes (maybe there's no mistakes)
                <br /><br />
                You break me, then I break my rules
                <br />Last time was the last time too
                <br />It's fucked up, I know, but I'm still
